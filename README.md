# Extracting prices of french TGVs

## Motivation 
If you want to perform a study of the evolution of french high speed train lines there are no databases available. This database is interesting in order to compare the range of prices (min-max), the evolution of the price base on the day, finding the optimal day to buy a tgv ticket... 

## Implementation 

This script scrapes the data using selenium. I was unable to perform the scraping with ouisncf but the prices are the same on the website trainline and easier to scrape.
